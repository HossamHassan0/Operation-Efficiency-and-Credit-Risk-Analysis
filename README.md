# Project Title 
Operation Efficiency and Credit Risk Analysis


# Project Overview
1. Operational Efficiency Insights
- Analyzed branch-level operational data to highlight:
- Workload Imbalance → Detected branches with high employee count but low transaction-per-employee, recommending reallocation of staff to    improve productivity.
- Digital Transition Gaps → A flat digital usage trend across months (except May & Jan) indicated poor digital adoption. Recommended staff - training and improved customer referral strategies to digital channels (app/web).
- Branch Workload vs Efficiency → Compared number of employees with branch activity to assess over/under-resourcing.

2. Credit Risk Analysis
- Using corporate lending data, the dashboard uncovered:
- High-Risk Branches → Highlighted branches where a high percentage of loans fell into risky categories. E.g., Branch 70 had 83% of its      loans marked High Risk.
- Risk by Sector → Identified that services and agriculture were the sectors with the highest credit risk, helping credit teams focus on     these industries during due diligence.
- NPL by Branch → Measured how much of each branch’s portfolio had turned into Non-Performing Loans, e.g., Branch 61 had 43% of total loans as NPL.
- NPL Conversion Rate → Calculated the rate of high-risk loans that transitioned into NPLs, revealing early signs of loan portfolio          deterioration.

  # Outcome
- Provided visibility into underperforming branches and resource inefficiencies.
- Enabled proactive risk management by identifying high-risk exposure across sectors and branches.
- Delivered insights to improve digital adoption, reduce NPLs, and optimize credit decision-making processes.
